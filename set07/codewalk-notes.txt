TA Comments on Design for q1:-
- implement HOF for program-to-strings
- write contract and purpose for the complex lambda defintions
- create-space purpose should have been more informative
- avoid magic constants
- format header should have had invariant 
- use helper functions to simplfy funcition definitions

suggestions for q1:
- format header helper functions can rather be a generalized function
- use locals to make function definitions simpler

TA Comments on Design for q2:-
- HOF implementation is missing for process-instructions
- avoid magic constants

suggestions for q2
- apply conds on the direction change only with one make probe call
- generalize your code (for move-forward-west /east/north/south)
